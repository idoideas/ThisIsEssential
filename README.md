So, of course, the internet can't have enough nice things. It must ask more. Well, [you asked for it](http://www.strawpoll.me/13964446/r). Here we go.

You heard about Andy Rubin, the co-founder of our beloved operating system Android.

You probably heard about his latest tech company, and their first device, the PH-1.

It is a beautifully designed phone. Ceramic back, Edge-to-edge screen, Gorilla Glass 5. What can go wrong?

Well, apparently there is a thing that can go wrong.

Because there are people where camera notches are not acceptable, and will never reach that's in their hands.

And there are people, where this notch is, in fact, ESSENTIAL. Are you one of them?

Introducing ***ThisIsEssential*** *by Idoideas*, a simulation of Essential Phone's notch for any Android device. Just to make it a necessity for you.

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/idoideas/ThisIsEssential/blob/master/ThisIsEssential.apk?raw=true), or [download the app directly from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idoideas.ThisIsEssential).

**Now supports all Android devices, all the way back to Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0!**

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you "permit drawing over apps".

**Android 8.0 Oreo users:** Please note that the notch will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to Android API limitations set by Google.

## How to Enable

1. Download and Install the app..
2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+ , click on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**Notice!** To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.
